   The `searchify.py` script transforms your search terms into Google search URLs, making it easier to search from a long list of terms from a database instead of having to copy paste each term.

   #### Usage:

   Simply run the script, and it will generate Google search URLs for a list of terms, handling special characters, leading/trailing spaces, and converting spaces to `+` in the URL turning them into valid Google search URLs that are clickable.

   ```bash
     python searchify.py
   ```
